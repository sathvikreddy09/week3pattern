# Week3  Command Pattern
As disscussed in the class I have implemenrted the command pattern. <br />
The remote automation tool & diner examples were very helpful.<br />
The main stucture for the pattern are
     Command <br />
     Concrete Command<br />
     Client <br />
     Invoker<br />
     Receiver<br />
     
In this program I have implemented the command pattern to optimised the battery useage in cars.<br />
The voice control commands in the car is used to => do and undo commands for AC & Lights.<br />
With the specific command the AC or Lights are executed. <br />
